# Socket Client Example

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates the use of the `socket` module to create a client that connects to a server using TCP/IP protocol.

## Overview

The `socket_client.py` script prompts the user to enter the IP address and port number of a server. Once these are provided, it connects to the server, sends a greeting message, and prints the response received from the server.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

To run this script, clone this repository or download the `socket_client.py` file directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinkerlev/socket_client.git
cd socket_client

Usage
To run the script, use the following command:
python socket_client.py
You will be prompted to enter the server's IP address and port number. After entering these details, the script will connect to the server and display the server's response.
